Bangalore has a great historical background but over the years we have lost touch with it to the point of neglecting this aspect of our lives . Many of us inhabitants of Bangalore in leading our hectic and cosmopolitan life's have , do not have a clear idea about the history of the city we are living in and it has become the least important factor . We as responsible and aware citizens we should take cognisance of this and do something about it . We must have the knowledge about our hometown and if someone asks us about it we should be able to give a justifiable answer and not look like immigrants or tourists in our own city . This is an audio walk you will hear a poem on the history of Banaglore. This is an audio walk,you will be listening to a poem which will unfold the history of Banaglore.</p>
